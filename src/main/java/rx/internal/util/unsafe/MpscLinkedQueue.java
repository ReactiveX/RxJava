 * This is a direct Java port of the MPSC algorithm as presented <a

 * Cores</a> by D. Vyukov. The original has been adapted to Java and it's quirks with regards to memory model and
 * layout:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Use inheritance to ensure no false sharing occurs between producer/consumer node reference fields.
 * <li>Use XCHG functionality to the best of the JDK ability (see differences in JDK7/8 impls).
 * </ol>
 * The queue is initialized with a stub node which is set to both the producer and consumer node references. From this
 * point follow the notes on offer/poll.
