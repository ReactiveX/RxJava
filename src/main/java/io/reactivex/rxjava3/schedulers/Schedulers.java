     * Wraps an {@link Executor} into a new {@link Scheduler} instance and delegates {@code schedule()}

     * <p>
     * The tasks scheduled by the returned {@code Scheduler} and its {@link io.reactivex.rxjava3.core.Scheduler.Worker Scheduler.Worker}
     * can be optionally interrupted.
     * <p>
     * If the provided executor doesn't support any of the more specific standard Java executor
     * APIs, tasks scheduled with a time delay or periodically will use the
     * {@link #single()} scheduler for the timed waiting
     * before posting the actual task to the given executor.
     * <p>
     * If the provided executor supports the standard Java {@link ExecutorService} API,
     * canceling tasks scheduled by this scheduler can be cancelled/interrupted by calling
     * {@link io.reactivex.rxjava3.disposables.Disposable#dispose()}. In addition, tasks scheduled with
     * a time delay or periodically will use the {@link #single()} scheduler for the timed waiting
     * before posting the actual task to the given executor.
     * <p>
     * If the provided executor supports the standard Java {@link ScheduledExecutorService} API,
     * canceling tasks scheduled by this scheduler can be cancelled/interrupted by calling
     * {@link io.reactivex.rxjava3.disposables.Disposable#dispose()}. In addition, tasks scheduled with
     * a time delay or periodically will use the provided executor. Note, however, if the provided
     * {@code ScheduledExecutorService} instance is not single threaded, tasks scheduled
     * with a time delay close to each other may end up executing in different order than
     * the original schedule() call was issued. This limitation may be lifted in a future patch.
     * <p>
     * The implementation of the Worker of this wrapper {@code Scheduler} can operate in both eager (non-fair) and
     * fair modes depending on the specified parameter. In <em>eager</em> mode, it will execute as many
     * non-delayed tasks as it can, which may result in a longer than expected occupation of a
     * thread of the given backing {@code Executor}. In other terms, it does not allow per-{@link Runnable} fairness
     * in case the worker runs on a shared underlying thread of the {@code Executor}. In <em>fair</em> mode,
     * non-delayed tasks will still be executed in a FIFO and non-overlapping manner, but after each task,
     * the execution for the next task is rescheduled with the same underlying {@code Executor}, allowing interleaving
     * from both the same {@code Scheduler} or other external usages of the underlying {@code Executor}.
     * <p>
     * Starting, stopping and restarting this scheduler is not supported (no-op) and the provided
     * executor's lifecycle must be managed externally:
     * <pre><code>
     * ExecutorService exec = Executors.newSingleThreadedExecutor();
     * try {
     *     Scheduler scheduler = Schedulers.from(exec, true, true);
     *     Flowable.just(1)
     *        .subscribeOn(scheduler)
     *        .map(v -&gt; v + 1)
     *        .observeOn(scheduler)
     *        .blockingSubscribe(System.out::println);
     * } finally {
     *     exec.shutdown();
     * }
     * </code></pre>
     * <p>
     * Note that the provided {@code Executor} should avoid throwing a {@link RejectedExecutionException}
     * (for example, by shutting it down prematurely or using a bounded-queue {@code ExecutorService})
     * because such circumstances prevent RxJava from progressing flow-related activities correctly.
     * If the {@link Executor#execute(Runnable)} or {@link ExecutorService#submit(Callable)} throws,
     * the {@code RejectedExecutionException} is routed to the global error handler via
     * {@link RxJavaPlugins#onError(Throwable)}. To avoid shutdown-related problems, it is recommended
     * all flows using the returned {@code Scheduler} to be canceled/disposed before the underlying
