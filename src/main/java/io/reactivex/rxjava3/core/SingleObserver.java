/**
 * Provides a mechanism for receiving push-based notification of a single value or an error.
 * <p>
 * When a {@code SingleObserver} is subscribed to a {@link SingleSource} through the {@link SingleSource#subscribe(SingleObserver)} method,
 * the {@code SingleSource} calls {@link #onSubscribe(Disposable)}  with a {@link Disposable} that allows
 * disposing the sequence at any time. A well-behaved
 * {@code SingleSource} will call a {@code SingleObserver}'s {@link #onSuccess(Object)} method exactly once or the {@code SingleObserver}'s
 * {@link #onError} method exactly once as they are considered mutually exclusive <strong>terminal signals</strong>.
 * <p>
 * Calling the {@code SingleObserver}'s method must happen in a serialized fashion, that is, they must not
 * be invoked concurrently by multiple threads in an overlapping fashion and the invocation pattern must
 * adhere to the following protocol:
 * <pre><code>    onSubscribe (onSuccess | onError)?</code></pre>
 * <p>
 * Subscribing a {@code SingleObserver} to multiple {@code SingleSource}s is not recommended. If such reuse
 * happens, it is the duty of the {@code SingleObserver} implementation to be ready to receive multiple calls to
 * its methods and ensure proper concurrent behavior of its business logic.
 * <p>
 * Calling {@link #onSubscribe(Disposable)}, {@link #onSuccess(Object)} or {@link #onError(Throwable)} with a
 * {@code null} argument is forbidden.
 * <p>
 * The implementations of the {@code onXXX} methods should avoid throwing runtime exceptions other than the following cases:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the argument is {@code null}, the methods can throw a {@code NullPointerException}.
 * Note though that RxJava prevents {@code null}s to enter into the flow and thus there is generally no
 * need to check for nulls in flows assembled from standard sources and intermediate operators.
 * </li>
 * <li>If there is a fatal error (such as {@code VirtualMachineError}).</li>
 * </ul>
 * @see <a href="http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html">ReactiveX documentation: Observable</a>

 *          the type of item the SingleObserver expects to observe
