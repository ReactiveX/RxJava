/**
 * The Flowable class that implements the Reactive-Streams Pattern and offers factory methods,
 * intermediate operators and the ability to consume reactive dataflows.
 * <p>
 * Reactive-Streams operates with {@code Publisher}s which {@code Flowable} extends. Many operators
 * therefore accept general {@code Publisher}s directly and allow direct interoperation with other
 * Reactive-Streams implementations.
 * <p>
 * The Flowable hosts the default buffer size of 128 elements for operators, accessible via {@link #bufferSize()},
 * that can be overridden globally via the system parameter {@code rx2.buffer-size}. Most operators, however, have
 * overloads that allow setting their internal buffer size explicitly.
 * <p>
 * The documentation for this class makes use of marble diagrams. The following legend explains these diagrams:

     * of the provided {@link FlowableOperator} for each individual downstream {@link Subscriber} and allows the

     * used in the subscription process going further upstream.
     * <p>
     * Generally, such a new {@code Subscriber} will wrap the downstream's {@code Subscriber} and forwards the

     * emission pattern the custom operator's business logic requires. In addition, such operator can intercept the

     * <p>
     * Note that implementing custom operators via this {@code lift()} method adds slightly more overhead by requiring
     * an additional allocation and indirection per assembled flows. Instead, extending the abstract {@code Flowable}
     * class and creating a {@link FlowableTransformer} with it is recommended.
     * <p>
     * Note also that it is not possible to stop the subscription phase in {@code lift()} as the {@code apply()} method
     * requires a non-null {@code Subscriber} instance to be returned, which is then unconditionally subscribed to
     * the upstream {@code Flowable}. For example, if the operator decided there is no reason to subscribe to the
     * upstream source because of some optimization possibility or a failure to prepare the operator, it still has to
     * return a {@code Subscriber} that should immediately cancel the upstream's {@code Subscription} in its
     * {@code onSubscribe} method. Again, using a {@code FlowableTransformer} and extending the {@code Flowable} is

     * By default, when a Publisher encounters an exception that prevents it from emitting the expected item

     * {@code onExceptionResumeNext} method, if the original Publisher encounters an exception, instead of
     * invoking its Subscriber's {@code onError} method, it will instead relinquish control to
     * {@code resumeSequence} which will invoke the Subscriber's {@link Subscriber#onNext onNext} method if it is
     * able to do so. In such a case, because no Publisher necessarily invokes {@code onError}, the Subscriber
     * may never know that an exception happened.

     * Example:
     *
     * This retries 3 times, each time incrementing the number of seconds it waits.
     *
     * <pre><code>
     *  Flowable.create((FlowableEmitter&lt;? super String&gt; s) -&gt; {
     *      System.out.println("subscribing");
     *      s.onError(new RuntimeException("always fails"));
     *  }, BackpressureStrategy.BUFFER).retryWhen(attempts -&gt; {
     *      return attempts.zipWith(Flowable.range(1, 3), (n, i) -&gt; i).flatMap(i -&gt; {
     *          System.out.println("delay retry by " + i + " second(s)");
     *          return Flowable.timer(i, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
     *      });
     *  }).blockingForEach(System.out::println);
     * </code></pre>
     *
     * Output is:
     *
     * <pre> {@code
     * subscribing
     * delay retry by 1 second(s)
     * subscribing
     * delay retry by 2 second(s)
     * subscribing
     * delay retry by 3 second(s)
     * subscribing
     * } </pre>
     * <p>
     * Note that the inner {@code Publisher} returned by the handler function should signal
     * either {@code onNext}, {@code onError} or {@code onComplete} in response to the received
     * {@code Throwable} to indicate the operator should retry or terminate. If the upstream to
     * the operator is asynchronous, signaling onNext followed by onComplete immediately may
     * result in the sequence to be completed immediately. Similarly, if this inner
     * {@code Publisher} signals {@code onError} or {@code onComplete} while the upstream is
     * active, the sequence is terminated with the same signal immediately.
     * <p>
     * The following example demonstrates how to retry an asynchronous source with a delay:
     * <pre><code>
     * Flowable.timer(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
     *     .doOnSubscribe(s -&gt; System.out.println("subscribing"))
     *     .map(v -&gt; { throw new RuntimeException(); })
     *     .retryWhen(errors -&gt; {
     *         AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();
     *         return errors
     *                   .takeWhile(e -&gt; counter.getAndIncrement() != 3)
     *                   .flatMap(e -&gt; {
     *                       System.out.println("delay retry by " + counter.get() + " second(s)");
     *                       return Flowable.timer(counter.get(), TimeUnit.SECONDS);
     *                   });
